## Environmental Policy Integrated Climate Model

The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate **(EPIC)** model, originally known as the Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator, is **designed to simulate a field, farm or small watershed**, that is homogenous in terms of climate, soil, land use, and topography. The model simulates biophysical and biogeochemical processes as influenced by climate, landscape, soil and management conditions.Processes simulated include plant growth and yield, water and wind erosion, and water, carbon and nutrient cycling. EPIC is capable of **simulating around hundred crops** including annual, perennial and woody cropping systems grown as monocultures or polycultures. Model has been validated for multiple crops and in over 30 countries and regions and it has been used to assess productivity, environmental impacts, sustainability and climate change impacts and mitigation. EPIC has regularly been used by federal programs to investigate potential impacts of agricultural policies.

The input files needed by EPIC majorly include weather, soil, crop management, and site data. These files are essential for the accurate simulation of various processes within the model. 

- **Weather Data**: This includes information on temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity. Accurate weather data is crucial for simulating plant growth, water balance, and erosion processes.
- **Soil Data**: This encompasses soil properties such as texture, structure, depth, organic matter content, and nutrient levels. Soil data is vital for modeling water infiltration, root growth, and nutrient cycling.
- **Crop Management**: This involves data on planting dates, crop types, irrigation practices, fertilization, and tillage operations. Proper crop management data ensures realistic simulation of agricultural practices and their impacts on yield and environmental outcomes.
- **Site Data**: This includes information on the geographical location, topography, and land use of the study area. Site data helps in understanding the spatial variability and its influence on the modeled processes.

These input files collectively enable EPIC to provide comprehensive and accurate simulations for various agricultural and environmental scenarios.
