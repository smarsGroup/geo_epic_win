     THIS FILE CONTAINS DEFINITIONS OF S-CURVE AND MISCELLANEOUS 
PARAMETERS USED IN EPIC0810 20110510.


    S-CURVE PARAMETERS

    AN S SHAPED CURVE IS USED TO DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOR OF MANY PROCESSES
IN EPIC. THE Y AXIS IS SCALED FROM 0-1 TO EXPRESS THE EFFECT OF A RANGE
IN THE X AXIS VARIABLE ON THE PROCESS BEING SIMULATED. THE S-CURVE MAY 
BE DESCRIBED ADEQUATELY BY TWO POINTS CONTAINED IN THIS FILE. IT IS CON-
VENIENT TO REPRESENT THE X AND Y COORDINATES OF THE TWO POINTS WITH TWO
NUMBERS CONTAINED IN THIS FILE. THE NUMBERS ARE SPLIT BY EPIC(THE X 
VALUE IS LEFT OF THE DECIMAL AND THE Y VALUE IS RIGHT OF THE DECIMAL).
THE TWO POINTS ARE CONTAINED IN AN ARRAY CALLED SCRP. TO ILLUSTRATE THE
PROCEDURE CONSIDER THE TWO SCRP VALUES IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE PARM0810
.DAT FILE(90.05,99.95). SCRP(1,1)=90.05, SCRP(1,2)=99.95. WHEN SPLIT WE
HAVE X1=90. Y1=0.05; X2=99. Y2=0.95. EPIC USES THESE TWO POINTS TO SOLVE
THE EXPONENTIAL EQ FOR TWO PARAMETERS THAT GUARANTEE THE CURVE ORIGINATES
AT ZERO, PASSES THROUGH THE TWO GIVEN POINTS, AND Y APPROACHES 1.0
AS X INCREASES BEYOND THE SECOND POINT. THE FORM OF THE EQ IS

     Y=X/(X+EXP(B1-B2*X))

WHERE B1 AND B2 ARE THE EPIC DETERMINED PARAMETERS.
